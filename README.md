# How to restore the first generation A1639 Apple HomePod! 
## Disclaimer

READ THROUGH THE COMPLETE GUIDE FIRST BEFORE TOUCHING **_ANYTHING!_** Then, re-read it again before you attempt an actual restore, as steps / software may have changed.

You perform all of this at your own risk with no promises, guarantees, warranty, whatever. Mistakes made with software can be restored with software, but mistakes made with hardware may need repair. Approach with care.

This guide was tested on Apple Silicon with MacOS. It _should_ work on Intel Macs or Linux, but do not ask me for help here. Ask in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/track44). Feel free to contribute steps to getting other platforms working.

You can only restore with currently signed HomePod OS versions! You can download the latest currently signed version to restore with here, or for fun try building your own using the steps at the bottom of this guide.

## How to restore your AHomePod!
### Prerequisites

p.0. You need a usb connection to your HomePod! The port on the pod is under the rubber base. Remove the base by wedging your fingers between the base and mesh, and prying it straight off. No heat necessary. It will stick right back on. I strongly suggest cleaning all the black adhesive off the base of your HomePod around the debug port to allow your adapter to sit flush and close. You can easily clean all the adhesive by rolling it up into bits with your fingertips.

p.0.0. While you can solder a usb cable directly to the debug port on the HomePod, it's not recommended, the pads are fragile. You can [make your own adapter,](https://github.com/UnbendableStraw/homepwn-simple) or buy premade adapters [here!](https://nicsfix.com/shop)

p.0.0.0. Do not disturb your dongle, HomePod, or any part of the USB cable while restoring. The pads are close together, with voltage next to data lines, and you risk failing to restore, or worse, shorting and damaging something. When you remove the adapter from the HomePod, be sure the USB cable is unplugged first, and power isn't plugged into the HomePod!

p.1. You need Homebrew installed: <https://brew.sh/>

**Note: _On some Macs, after you install homebrew for the first time in your terminal, you will see "Next Steps, Run these two commands..." Run those two commands!!_** Verify your Homebrew install is working with the command: `brew doctor`

p.2. Now run these commands, one at a time. This taps David's repo, then installs the necessary restore tools. For now, we are also installing a specific version of idevicerestore to workaround a bug in the latest version:
```
brew tap d235j/ios-restore-tools
brew install --HEAD libimobiledevice-glue
brew install --HEAD d235j/ios-restore-tools/libimobiledevice
brew install --HEAD libirecovery
brew install --HEAD gaster
brew install --HEAD ldid-procursus
brew install libzip
brew uninstall d235j/ios-restore-tools/idevicerestore
git clone https://github.com/libimobiledevice/idevicerestore.git 
cd idevicerestore
git checkout d2e1c4f
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
```

If you get an error running the `brew uninstall` command, you can ignore it, this is just to make sure you don't have a conflicting version of idevicerestore. Warnings are also usually OK to ignore.

You are now set up to restore HomePods! From here on, you just need to run the next steps anytime you want to restore a(nother) HomePod unless any major updates come out.

### Restore Steps

1. IN ORDER: Place and keep your HomePod upside down. Then, connect the adapter to the HomePod. Then, plug the usb cable into computer. Only then, can you plug power into HomePod. 

  * * It is important you do this in order. With the adapter attached to your HomePod, keep pod upside down. USB to PC first. Then power to pod. 

  * * Some macs will have "Allow Accessory to Connect" prompts along the way, Allow them! Pay attention to more prompts while running restore process, too.

2. Run the following commands, one at a time. Replace YOUR.ipsw with the location of your .ipsw file. You can drag your .ipsw file from Finder into your Terminal window to populate it's path. 

```
gaster pwn
gaster reset
idevicerestore -d -e YOUR.ipsw
```
* * Do not disturb HomePod or cable during restore process!!

3. Be patient! It can take up to 10-15 minutes. Once you see `Restore Complete`, it will still appear to be bootlooping / blinking volume buttons, thats expected! Continue waiting about a minute, then you can unplug power from your HomePod, then unplug the usb cable, then remove adapter from HomePod. Flip the HomePod rightside up, reconnect power and wait for it to reboot a few times and initialize set-up!

Now you can set it up and use like any other HomePod. This does not break over the air updates or any features / functionality.

## Troubleshooting

If the restore is unsuccessful, try again from Restore Step 1. Usually though, errors are caused by faulty hardware, bad connection to the HomePod, or you didn't do something right.

* If you get an ERROR: about `Unable to get SHSH blobs for this device` or `This device isn't eligible` or `Unable to send iBEC to device`, you are likely using the wrong version of idevicerestore or an unsigned .ipsw. Try redownloading or rebuilding your .ipsw, and installing the specific version of idevicerestore mentioned in Prerequisite Step 4. 
* Is your HomePod upside down while attempting all of this?
* Did you connect the HomePod's USB first, then connect power to HomePod?
* Did you run `gaster pwn`, then `gaster reset`, then `idevicerestore -d -e YOUR.ipsw` all while your HomePod was connected, on, and upside down?
* Restart your computer and try again from Restore Step 1.
* If you get an `Unable to restore device` error because of `failure when attempting to flash the nitrogen firmware`, try again from step 1 and it should work.
* If you consistently get `Possibly invalid iBec` error, or `Waiting on NAND` during restore, it's probably hardware failure (nand / bga)
* If you are not able to `gaster pwn` your HomePod, it's likely a hardware failure or bad USB connection.
* Basically, it _should_ restore successfully if it's purely a software brick, and your connection to the HomePod is good.

* You may see many repeating timeout messages like so:
>
> ```
> ReverseProxy[Conn]: Received Ping command, replying with Pong
> ReverseProxy[Conn]: Connection closed
> ReverseProxy[Conn]: (status=2) Terminated
> No data to read (timeout)
> No data to read (timeout)
> No data to read (timeout)
> No data to read (timeout)
> No data to read (timeout)
> ```
>
This is normal and may take up to 10â€“15 minutes.


## How to build your own .ipsw

You don't need to do this, only if you want to try building an .ipsw yourself. Accomplish the prerequisites first. This is actively being worked on to be made easier. 

1. Download the latest ./makeipsw.sh from [tihmstar's repo](https://github.com/tihmstar/homepodstuff)
2. Download the desired signed, full OTA .zip for AudioAccessory1,1 (from ipsw.me). You need the one with the full ramdisk (usually the largest one with no prerequisites)
3. Download the same version of the signed full .ipsw for AppleTV5,3 (from ipsw.me)
* example: [this](https://ipsw.me/download/ota/AudioAccessory1,1/21M71?prerequisite=) for the ota.zip and [this](https://ipsw.me/download/AppleTV5,3/21M71) for the .ipsw file
4. Download the `firmware_keys.zip` from this repo. Currently working for 17.5, 17.6, and 18.0. (new / self key generation coming soon to makeipsw.sh script)
5. `chmod +x makeipsw.sh`
6. `brew reinstall ra1nsn0w` (to ensure you have the latest version)
7. `./makeipsw.sh PATH_TO_HOMEPOD_OTA.zip PATH_TO_APPLETV.ipsw PATH_TO_OUTPUT.ipsw PATH_TO_firmware_keys.zip`
* Point the first path to the latest signed, FULL ota .zip for AudioAccessory1,1 file you downloaded
* Point the second path to the latest signed, FULL .ipsw for AppleTV5,3 file you downloaded
* Point the third path to where you want your .ipsw to be output, along with a name (like ~\Desktop\nic\homepod.ipsw)
* Point the fourth path to where you downloaded the keys.zip file from this repo
